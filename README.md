# GameScript Java Edition

**This is a cool project for doing cool printing( like `System.out.printLn(); / System.out.print(); `), which in this case you can run without editing and you will see a star in the middle of the screen, which can be changed position and player icon later in `main.java`.**


**Ask anything in [Issues](https://github.com/nikeedev/GameScript_java/issues), or if you got any ideas or bugs about it!**

----------------------

### Requirements

**`Java JDK` installed, `Java` installed, optionally:(a code editor where you can run it easly, like Intellij Idea for Java projects), and a PC for running it comfortlably for you!**
